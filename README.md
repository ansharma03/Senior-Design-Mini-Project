# Senior-Design-Mini-Project

Anika Sharma:

For the mini-project, Xinyu and I met Monday evening to go over the project details together and split up the workload evenly.

On **Monday, September 13**, we had decided as a team that Xinyu would focus on the barcode scanning aspect of the app while I would look into obtaining and connecting the API key from the FDA website to have access to the nutrition information needed.

Before we met on Monday, I played around with Android Studio and refamiliarized myself with the application, as I had previously used the software in order to create an Android App for EC327. I also set up my REACT native environment on my laptop using the tutorial provided on the project slides. In addition to that, I watched some Youtube videos on React Native, rest API's, and Firebase to gain a better understanding of what is expected of us for this mini project.

On **Wednesday, September 15**, I completed both the REACT native tutorial on the official website and setup my Firebase. I also created a new AVD that would be compatible with the app being developed for this project.

On **Thursday, September 16**, I created a project on Android Studio and began working on connecting the FDA API, Firebase, and using GITHUB secrets to store the API key. I saved the API key as a secret in the Github Repository. I had some difficulty creating a new project on my Firebase account with my school email, so I ended up using my personal email in order to create this new project. I also had some difficulties having Android Studio run a new project I created through Windows Powershell using npm, so I will try again tomorrow in order to narrow down where the issue is and work on connecting the application to the Firebase project along with allowing access to the API key.

The firebase project can be found at this link connected to my personal email (anikash03@gmail.com): https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/barcode-scanner-bd7d2/overview
(NO LONGER APPLICABLE)

On **Friday, September 17**, Xinyu and I communicated and he decided to connect a firebase project under his email to the Barcode application. My main goal for the day is to implement the FDA API so that the app has access to the nutrition information.
