# Senior-Design-Mini-Project

Anika Sharma:

For the mini-project, Xinyu and I met Monday evening to go over the project details together and split up the workload evenly.

On **Monday, September 13**, we had decided as a team that Xinyu would focus on the barcode scanning aspect of the app while I would look into obtaining and connecting the API key from the FDA website to have access to the nutrition information needed.

Before we met on Monday, I played around with Android Studio and refamiliarized myself with the application, as I had previously used the software in order to create an Android App for EC327. I also set up my REACT native environment on my laptop using the tutorial provided on the project slides. In addition to that, I watched some Youtube videos on React Native, rest API's, and Firebase to gain a better understanding of what is expected of us for this mini project.

On **Wednesday, September 15**, I completed both the REACT native tutorial on the official website and setup my Firebase.

On **Thursday, September 16**, I created a project on Android Studio and began working on connecting the FDA API, Firebase, and using GITHUB secrets to store the API key.
